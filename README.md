# Scientific Sampling

Large-deviation sampling methods (Wang-Landau, Replica-exchange Wang-Landau, entropic sampling), bootstrap resampling, histograms, heat maps and more.

The Documentation can be found [here](https://pardoxa.github.io/sampling/sampling/).


# WORK IN PROGRESS

This crate is not published on [crates.io](https://crates.io/) yet, though it will be once I finished 
the important parts and polished the Documentation a little bit.

Currently working on Replica exchange Wang-Landau. The rest should already be functional and I already use it for simulations
